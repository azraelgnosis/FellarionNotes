[[Trajedie]] and [[AnnieLashawn]] were wizardly apprentices to [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] alongside [[Roderick]] until some event, which [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] cannot recall for some reason, which resulted in [[Roderick]]'s death. Subsequently, [[Trajedie]] and [[AnnieLashawn]] have become [[Nathamuel]]'s apprentices and [[Trajedie]] has not spoken since.
