two-actions
Cantrip 1
Cantrip Concentrate Illusion Manipulate Subtle 
Source Player Core pg. 331
PFS Note If a visual figment occupies the entirety of a 5x5 cube, it can provide cover or concealment, but not both, for a medium or smaller creature. It does not block line of sight.

Traditions arcane, occult
Bloodline fey
Range 30 feet
Duration sustained
You create a simple illusory sound or vision. A sound adds the auditory trait to the spell and the sound can't include intelligible words or elaborate music. A vision adds the visual trait, can be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and is clearly crude and undetailed if viewed from within 15 feet. When you Cast or Sustain the Spell, you can attempt to Create a Diversion with the illusion, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to your Deception check. If the attempt fails against a creature, that creature disbelieves the figment.
