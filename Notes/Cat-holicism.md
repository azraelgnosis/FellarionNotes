[[Mawrth]] was destroyed by "the Devil's Hairball"

"Inside you lives two cats..." self-help Book

Cat FamFolk are...
- Uplifted familiars
- The chosen people
- Abominations
- Some combination thereof

One sect believes:
The Catfolk were the original people and/or the other FamFolk are uplifted familiars but Catfolk are not. After all, Humans are not uplifted Monkeys familiars... or are they?

How do we feel about people who wear cat ears and tails???
