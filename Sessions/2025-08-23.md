- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] begins to introduce [[Cwm]] and [[Cawlwyd]] to the rest of the wagon.
- A wild [[Omi]] appears! Riding [[Pepperoni|Pepperoni the Corgi]]  trotting into our encampment.
- [[Cawlwyd]] mentions that he is in fact, a prince of [[Yr Orllewin]], from the [[Owl Clan]]
- Upon hearing that [[Balin ferch Balin|Princess Balin]] was present, [[Cawlwyd]] went off to meet with her.
- Meanwhile, [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] and [[Cwm]] get into an altercation wherein [[Cwm]] LIES that [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]]'s mother [[Rhiannon]] STOLE [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]]'s sword from the [[Owl Clan]] and tries to steal it from him. How dare?!
- It seems [[Cwm]]'s father is likewise missing, presumably since sometime around when [[Rhiannon]] went missing.
- [[Omi]] takes [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] aside and informs him that they had seen, apparently, [[Rhiannon]] and presumably [[Cwm]]'s father dancing in the court of the Fairy King.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] spends the night polishing his sword.

- A courier arrives on a stag with a message for [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] from [[Sir Trent]]
- In the messages, [[Sir Trent]] explains that he has taken a job working for [[Nathamuel]] so that he can spy on him.
- Also, his wife is about to explode soon and, consequently, no longer be pregnant.
- [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] has a response sent saying, essentially, "nooo don't" but also it will probably be too late by the time it arrives.

- [[Claudia|Princess Claudia]] calls [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]] and then [[Petrara Umbriel|Dae'na]] over for a secret meeting.
- At some point, [[Helix]], [[Cwm]], and [[Cawlwyd]] had disappeared from the caravan.
- It seems that [[Petrara Umbriel|Dae'na]]'s travel bag has been discretely replaced by [[Taliesen]]'s bag, which is filled with rocks.
- Meanwhile, [[AnnieLashawn]] confronts [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] about giving one of the human princes his famous [[Desclan's Sleepytime Tea]].
- [[Omi]] intercedes, successfully casting [[Sleep]] on [[AnnieLashawn]].
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] inquires with [[Balin ferch Balin|Princess Balin]] regarding the whereabouts of [[Cwm]] and [[Cawlwyd]]. They haven't been seen since morning. She then mentions that some [[Cave Elf|Cave Elves]] showed up at the portal searching for [[Petrara Umbriel|Dae'na]] and [[Gwynt]] and alludes to some secret information.
- The party notices that [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] is in the midst of heating a peculiar topaz and onyx gem over a fire.
- While touching the topaz, [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]  experiences a vision of a vast desert, apparently a view of where the topaz wants to be taken to in order to incorporate.
- [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] drops it as [[AnnieLashawn]] is awakening. She sees it and picks it up, experience (presumably) the same vision. Then determines to take it for herself.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] intercedes, starting initiative.
