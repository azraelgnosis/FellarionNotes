# Synopsis
- At the next wagon round up, a council is convened.
- [[Claudia|Princess Claudia]] chastises the party for allowing [[Hades]] to direct the caravan and allow us to get off course and insists that she be kept account of and demands greater transparency about our directions.
- [[Petra|Dae'na]] gets a little drunk off of [[Orcish Ale]](tm)(c)(r) and hangs out with [[Gwynt]]
- [[Hades]] continues to be a scamp.
- [[Gwynt]] performs a traditional [[Hawk Clan]] song about great feats performed by grand ancestors. The entire encampment is enthralled, except for the shady folks being shady, as they are wont to do.
- The party resolves to tie up [[Hades]] so that she doesn't escape in the night.
