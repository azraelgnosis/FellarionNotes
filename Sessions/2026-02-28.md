# Synopsis
- The Godthief wagon is at the outskirts of the city on their way to the next city, [[Roumpīni]].
- [[Palug]] seems a bit withdrawn, clearly grieving.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] directs the wagon to pause so everyone can have it out.
- [[Palug]] wishes to be responsible to hold onto the [[Topaz]], as [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]'s apprentice.
- [[Palug]] reveals that in the vision he and [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] experienced, the [[Topaz]] indicated that it wanted to be given over to [[Gwynt]]. Which seems bad.
## Outside Roumpīni
- A wild [[Pleione]] appears! Alongside her crew (the [[Royal Bounty Hunting Task Force]])
- [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] and [[Pleione]] catch up about what's gone on.
- A wild [[Trajedie]] and [[AnnieLashawn]] appears!
- They claim to wish to pay their respects to [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] and travel until we reach [[Roumpīni]].
- [[Pleione]] continue on to the city.
- The wagon continues.
- [[Issa]] and [[Trajedie]] have a magic [[Message]] conversion.
- [[AnnieLashawn]] broaches the subject of divvying up [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]'s stuff as "inheritance"/\.
## Roumpīni
- As the wagon approaches [[Roumpīni]], a group of orange-bedecked [[Cave Elf|Cave Elves]] block the way.
- They finish casting a spell and then immediately at the wagon.
- They have a short exchange with [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]]. They ask to ride along on our wagon back to the city proper.
- [[Issa]] has an... eventful conversation with them.
- Gnomes get mentioned! They apparently haven't pushed the elves too far in some direction.
- [[Issa]] shouts out for assistance. [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] gets out of the wagon to see what is going on.
- [[Electo]] starts flirting with [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]]. [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] notices [[Megaera]] noticing [[Issa]] check to make sure he still has the [[Quartz]] on him.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] notices phlhlthi cast a spell then look towards where [[Palug]] is sitting inside the Wagon.
- [[Mabrian]] fails to [[Shove]] phlthlhthi who seems otherwise unconcerned by this.
- [[Issa]] casts [[Thoughtful Gift]] sending the [[Quartz]] in his pocket into  [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]]'s hands, triggering a vision.
- [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]] seems himself dropping the [[Quartz]] at the [[Sikhas Grotto]].
- Battle initiates!
## Battle Commences
- [[Scylla]] grabs the [[Topaz]] and flees while [[Megara]] grabs [[Issa]], running in the opposite direction.
- Once [[Scylla]] has a good headstart, [[Tisiphone2]], [[Megara]] and [[Electo]] scatter, avoiding notice.
- [[Scylla]] pulls off a series of [[Suggestion]] spells, telling [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]] to "leave me alone" , telling [[Palug]] to "come along", telling [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] to "bring Palug" and telling [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] to retrieve the stones from [[AnnieLashawn]].
- [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]] manages to grab [[Palug]]'s backpack full of the gems and sneaks the [[Topaz]] from his pocket but these are taken by [[AnnieLashawn]] in turn. Who then proceeds to placidly return to the wagon.
- [[Issa]] tries to cut [[Scylla]], [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]], and [[Palug]] off but neither he nor [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] can't catch up to a [[Haste|Hasted]] [[Scylla]] . All too quickly, [[Scylla]] has disappeared with [[Palug]] as well as the [[Quartz]] in her clutches.
