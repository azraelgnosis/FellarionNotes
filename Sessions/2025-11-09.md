# Synopsis
- [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] awakes with a start! Someone's at the door. A ~~courier~~ page with a note, except its in Elvish! [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] seeks out [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] to translate.
- The letter is from [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]]'s mother. It is encoded; she wants [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] and [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] to stop by the flower shop before leaving.
- Moonflower, Hyacinths, Mountain Honeysuckle. In the Hyacinth blossoms is a hedgehog quill.
- A page arrives at [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] and [[Finn]]'s room with two scrolls. One is from the Queen, written in Common; the other is in Elvish and grants the holder the Queen's authorization to facilitate our search
- [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]] wakes up ~~dead~~. Apparently there's supposed to be a group breakfast/brunch for everyone including the monarchs.
- [[Issa]] acknowledges to [[Trajedie]] that he isn't fully qualified to officiate a Human wedding but they agree to figure something out.
- [[Apollo|Prince Apollo]] and his Man-in-waiting [[Perses]] appear at [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]]'s door. [[Apollo]] hopes [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] will visit [[Hermes]] and verify that [[Hyacinthus]], who is being held with [[Hermes]], is OK.
- [[Gwynt]] rises with the dawn, which we cannot see, as we are underground.

- For breakfast: Monster eggs, mushrooms (maybe glowing), croissant-wiches, etc.
- [[King's Shadow]] declines to eat?!
- [[Javert|Sir Javert]] loves jerky, turkey, ~~smirk-y~~ [[Smeurky]] (smoked jerky wrapped around turkey), other things that rhyme
- [[Rhedynfr]] feels a little, teensy bit slighted; sitting at the guard table separated from all of the other Orcs. [[Rhedynfr]] makes a pass at [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]], unsuccessfully.
- [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] defends [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] honor to [[Rhedynfr]] regarding the kidnapping of [[Balin ferch Balin|Princess Balin]].
- [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] waxes poetic at [[Rhedynfr]]. 
- [[Rhedynfr]] leans in ~~for a kiss~~ to express his concern about the [[Mawrth|Mawrthiad]].  The [[King's Shadow]] takes notice. 
- [[Kyle Dawnguard|Sir Kyle]] ~~is~~ comes across as a bit of a Pick Me.
- [[AnnieLashawn]] doesn't engage in innuendo or subterfuge; she wants that gem.
- [[AnnieLashawn]] threatens elder abuse! [[AnnieLashawn]] definitely juices!
- [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] and [[AnnieLashawn]] exchange words.
- [[Kyle Dawnguard|Sir Kyle]] is giving golden retriever.
- [[Issa]] has a somewhat awkward ~~flirting session~~ conversation with [[Aroura]], then offers to pay her for... something?
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] shoots his shot with [[Artemis]]. She states that she hunts monsters, proper monsters, and that he should follow up with the city guard regarding the whereabouts of [[Taliesen]].
- [[Issa]] "stayed" with [[Trajedie]] the previous night. It appears that [[Trajedie]] has ensorclled [[Issa]] somehow.
- [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] expresses her concern with the [[Topaz]] remaining in [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]'s possession where it might be stolen by ne'er-do-wells.
- God-thief crew rise up!
- The group returns to [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]]'s room to discuss further. [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] and [[Kyle Dawnguard]] exercise a bit together, then [[Kyle Dawnguard]] fucks off for a bit to freshen up.
- [[Palug]] confronts [[Issa]] about stealing the [[Topaz]] from [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]. [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] attempts to use [[Telekinetic Hand]] to take it from him and touches it to [[Palug]] for a short time before [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] is able to grab it.
- [[Palug]] has a mysterious vision and may or may not be possessed! He asks [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] to hand him the [[Topaz]] so that he can touch him ([[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]) with it so that "he might see the same vision"
- [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] has a very detailed vision. [[Palug]] hands it back to him. They both seem troubled.
- [[Palug]] the [[Topaz]] showed him promises and threats and what it wanted.
- [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]], the [[Topaz]] showed him a past event that resulted in [[Roderick]]'s death and [[Trajedie]] and [[AnnieLashawn]] falling to [[Nathamuel]]'s influence. But suggested it could fix this if they give it to [[Gwynt]].
- [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] was right; the [[Topaz]] is a lying liar and should not be listened too.
- It seems the [[Topaz]] threatened to kill or otherwise bring about the death of [[Palug]].
- [[Issa]] recalls that [[Trajedie]] mentioned not liking how [[AnnieLashawn]] has been behaving lately.
- [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]] has been voluntold to ~~eat a fireball to the face~~ lead [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]'s security detail to protect him from [[AnnieLashawn]]. We will sing his praises.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]], [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]], [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]], [[Issa]] and [[Gwynt]] go to the guard station to inquire about [[Taliesen]].
- One of the guards admits to ~~malfeasance~~ that an [[Orc]] was relinquished to them by a "ne'er-do-well" some time ago but they lost track of him because they are bad at their jobs.
- Meanwhile, [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] ~~is disappeared into a Cave Elf black site~~ heads off to discretely visit [[Hermes]].
- The person behind the front desk gives [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] a tour of the premises; [Girls! Girls! Girls! by Emilie Autumn](https://open.spotify.com/track/5hNpgLjnZpnaDNhwKWjjhm?si=nW8uHR-PTb6jMADEYkC-mw) plays in the back of our minds.
- Meanwhile, Guard Captain [[Eunomia]] has shown up and invites [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] and [[Gwynt]] back to her office.
- She admits that because the wanted poster was ambiguous and they don't share a language, she sent him away to be "educated".
- [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] discovers [[Hermes]] in the facility. Unrelated, [[Ganymede]] and [[Hyacinthus]] have been ~~naughty~~ unwilling to acquiesce to masculinization therapy it seems.
- [[Hermes]] mentions that [[Hyacinthus]] is in a "special dinner" with [[Zephyr|Dr. Zephyr]] and [[Taliesen|"Ganymede"]].
- There is a commotion and [[Hyacinthus]] and [[Taliesen|"Ganymede"]] are walked out of the room by [[Zephyr|Dr. Zephyr]].
- [[Zephyr|Dr. Zephyr]] explains that "[[Taliesen|Ganymede]]" was released into their care by the city guard. Also, alludes to [[Hermes]] may be able to be released soon on good behavior. Perhaps.
- The [[Eunomia|Guard Captain]] says she can't direct the party to the facility [[Taliesen]] is at, even at the cost of her job, but that we can go back to the [[Leto|Queen]] to get her OK.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] threatens violence. There can't be THAT many guards, right?
- What is the party to do? Find out next time, on The Party Wagon!
