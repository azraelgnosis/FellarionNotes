# Synopsis
- [[Issa]] awakens in bed surrounded by his friends.
- [[Issa]] shows everyone the bit of parchment that was lost amongst [[Trajedie]]'s things.
- [[Javert|Sir Javert]] arrives to inform [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] & [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]] that their presence is missed at the party.
- The party remembers that [[Palug]] had gone off to find [[Eurydice]]. 
## Back at the party
- [[AnnieLashawn]] is witnessed having an intense conversation with [[Apollo|Prince Apollo]]'s men-in-waiting
- [[Zephyr|Dr. Zephyr]] confronts [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] just inside the door. She references having "seen" him during the "Boar Incident" but [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] blows her off, focusing on the task at hand.
- [[Issa]] approaches [[Gilfaethwy]] and asks if he recognizes [[Trajedie]] and discuss his little brother [[Gwydion]], who was amongst [[Trajedie]]'s "subjects"
- [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]'s presence is requested by [[Leto|Queen Leto]] accompanied by [[Trajedie]]. [[Mabrian]] accompanies him, showing the UTMOST restraint.
- [[Trajedie]] shows a [[Figment]] of the flower purchase order from [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]. [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] shows them the physical copy he recovered from the crime scene. 
- [[Leto|Queen Leto]] grills [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] about why this purchase order was found where [[Orpheus]] was disappeared. 
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] interjects that [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] couldn't be responsible, since he relinquished the paper to the Flower shop. 
- [[Mabrian]] calls [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] over to elaborate. [[Leto|Queen Leto]] suggests, in that case, the Flower Shop should be investigated. The group struggles to explain why none of them are responsible without also accusing [[Trajedie]] without evidence.
## Meanwhile with Issa
- [[Issa]] sneaks into the [[Dynasdywyll Temple]]
- [[Issa]] notices a pedestal with a number of [[Crystal Gems|glowing gems]] in a section of the Temple Library. The [[Quartz]] calls to him enticingly but he resists picking it up and instead does research into the gems.
- [[Quartz]], [[Rose Quartz]], [[Aquamarine]], [[Moonstone]], [[Opal]]
- Scripture laments the inability to actually destroy any of the stones. It took the power of all of the other gems (especially [[Onyx]]) to seal [[Topaz]] away.
## Back at the party
- [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]] takes off some of the heat from [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] by distracting [[Leto|Queen Leto]] with talk of cats, which [[Leto|Queen Leto]] is unfamiliar with. [[Cassandra]] is called over by means of comparison. [[Leto|Queen Leto]] shows off her pet [[Stargut Hydra]].
- [[Leto|Queen Leto]] brings up that the party does, in fact, have an alibi: that we were off rescuing the boys from the clutches of the vile [[Zephyr|Dr. Zephyr]] when [[Orpheus]] went missing.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] interjects that while we didn't see these documents ourselves, our companion [[Gwynt]] did. [[Leto|Queen Leto]] says that he will be interrogated prior to the caravan's departure and dismissed the group.
## Back at the Temple Library
- ~~[[Issa]] congratulates himself on resisting the pull of the [[Quartz]]. As he walks away, he reaches into his pocket... there is a strange lump there.~~ As [[Issa]] prepares to depart, he feels the draw of the [[Quartz]]. He resists but his will is overpowered and he leaves with all but the [[Opal]]
- [[Issa]] returns to the castle and, not finding anyone, hides all of the stones in [[Palug]]'s bag. What could go wrong?!
## Back at the party
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] goes over to talk to the men-in-waiting. He, perhaps gives too much away regarding the presence of the [[Topaz]] in order to cast aspersions regarding the intentions of [[AnnieLashawn]].
- Apparently, when [[AnnieLashawn]] had come over to talk, she was just asking them about their experiences with [[Zephyr|Dr. Zephyr]].
## Back with Issa
- [[Issa]] comes across [[Artemis|Princess Artemis]], [[Orion|Prince Consort Orion]], and [[Palug]]. Apparently, they were coming from the Black Site gathering evidence of what [[Zephyr|Dr. Zephyr]] had been getting up to.
- [[Artemis|Princess Artemis]] and [[Orion|Prince Consort Orion]] exeunt.
- [[Issa]] insinuates that [[Palug]] may have "left a paper behind", trying to gauge his reaction.
- [[Issa]] admits to [[Palug]] that he was jealous of [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] taking him under his wing as a [[Wizard]]. [[Issa]] informs that all of the God stones that he took are hidden in [[Palug]]'s bag. New stones, not the ones [[Petrara]] took. Now they're in cahoots.
- [[Issa]] and [[Palug]] return to the Temple and witness several Elves searching around the premises. They promptly return to the party.
- [[Issa]] casts [[Message]]
- [[Desclan Tanner]] has a heart attack! 
- With his last words, [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] proclaims that this is all [[Nathamuel]]'s fault.
- [[Palug]] starts giving him mouth-to-mouth then, less-than-stealthily, reaches into [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]'s pocket for the [[Topaz]]. [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] pretends to faint to draw attention.
- [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]] notices that when [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] collapsed, [[Issa]] had been looking at him intently and muttering under his breath. But [[Issa]] explains that he didn't intentionally kill [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]].
- [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] and [[Taliesen]] get in on the distraction as [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]] takes over sneaking the [[Topaz]] off of [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]'s body.
- [[Issa]] and [[Palug]] insist that the party must leave immediately so we can ~~kill [[Nathamuel]] with [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]'s ashes~~ mourn [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]].
- [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] reaffirms her status as the OG Godthief!
- [[Palug]] lifts [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]]'s body to take him away; [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] lifts the both of them.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] notices that [[Trajedie]] is openly weeping while [[AnnieLashawn]] remains stoic, shedding a single tear.
- The Party Wagon has evolved into: **The Godthieves!**
- [[Claudia|Princess Claudia]] arranges to have the caravan depart prematurely, mentioning that [[Leto|Queen Leto]] feels a bit guilty about contributing to [[Desclan Tanner]]'s untimely death.
- The Godthief wagon gains ~~two~~ three [[Giant Axolotl]] (purple/turquoise and turqoise/purple and a third thing) to pull the wagon, in addition to their three [[Elk]].
- At some point, [[Issa]] touches the [[Quartz]] and experiences a vision of himself releasing it into a pool at some temple ruins.
