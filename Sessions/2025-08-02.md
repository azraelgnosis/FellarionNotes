# Synopsis
- [[Petrara Umbriel|Dae'na]] makes an effort to connect with [[Finn]] over the week of travel.
- [[Thibedeaux Ironbayou|Thibedeaux]] has a weird dream featuring his childhood friend [[Blibadoo]] which ended dramatically with the Dwarf King and the comet and the explosion.
- A dragon/storm approaches!
- [[Petrara Umbriel|Dae'na]] stays out wishing to contact the dragon; ~~Dawn rolls up her background character~~.
- [[Issa]] places a [[Sigil]] on [[Alrick]] who is pretending to be his brother [[Elrick]].
- [[Alrick]] asks [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] for drugs and receives some of sleepy time tea.
- [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] gathers the party to have a secret meeting about his history as a [[Conjuration]] practitioner and machinations that diverted his studies which might have otherwise resulted in a more capable portal for the refugees. As well as his suspicions regarding [[Trajedie]] and [[AnnieLashawn]] acting as agents of [[Nathamuel]].
- It's the party's turn to scout for danger.
- Shortly after setting out, [[Balin ferch Balin|Princess Balin]] sneaks up to the party, having snuck away from the caravan.
- [[Gwynt]] insists that [[Balin ferch Balin|Princess Balin]] return and accompanies her. However, she disappears on their way back.
- [[Gwynt]] calls out to [[Balin ferch Balin|Princess Balin]], alerting the rest of the party to her absence. 
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] is distracted by what appears to be [[Taliesen]]'s voice and wanders off.
- The rest of the party follows and discovers [[Balin ferch Balin|Princess Balin]] tied up and [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] being bewitched by a group of [[Harpy|Harpies]].
- Battle breaks out; it doesn't seem to be going great.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] tosses [[Balin ferch Balin|Princess Balin]] onto the stag and she and [[Issa]] return to the caravan as [[Petrara Umbriel|Dae'na]] parlays with the [[Harpy|Harpies]].
- The [[Harpy|Harpies]] offer to be hired as spies who will eat our enemies instead but not everyone is on board.
- [[Seal Team Silver Wagon]] catch up to the party; the [[Harpy|Harpies]] don't seem bothered by this.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] gets tired of discussion and attacks the nearest [[Harpy]].
