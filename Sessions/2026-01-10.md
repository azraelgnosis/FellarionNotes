# Synopsis
- [[Omi]] inadvertently sets off everyone's paranoia. Could the [[Cave Scorpion]]s have been intentionally sent to ambush the caravan?
- [[Omi]] and [[Issa]] meet with the rest of the [[Halfling|Halflings]] in the party.
- [[Issa]] has feelings about being the only [[Halfling]] not in the polycule. Those feelings are that it's fine.
- The party returns to [[Leto|Queen Leto]]'s offices. [[Leto|Queen Leto]], [[Artemis]] and [[Apollo]] are deep in conversation.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] insists on being able to see [[Taliesen]] but [[Leto|the Queen]] isn't about it. [[Palug]] tries to convince [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] not to storm the castle to find [[Taliesen]].
- [[Issa]] (and [[Omi]]) talk with a random guard, hoping she'd direct the group to where [[Taliesen]] is.
- The guard takes us (minus [[Omi]] who is too femme) to where the men-in-waiting are held.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] and [[Taliesen]] reunite and introduces the other present members of the party and it's not awkward at all.
- [[Issa]] and [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] visit the Temple and meet with [[Polyhymnia E]], a cleric of the [[Emerald]]
 - [[Polyhymnia E]] explain some of the history of the [[Cave Elf]] gem religion, particularly regarding the dynamic between the [[Sapphire]] and [[Topaz]].
- [[Polyhymnia E]] explains that, should you touch one of the tones (hypothetically), you would be shown the deity's nexus of power which would summon them if placed there.
- [[Issa]] and [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] ask too many questions and get themselves ejected from the Temple.
- [[Issa]] returns to his room with [[Trajedie]]; [[Trajedie]] is sad (so what's new?). [[AnnieLashawn]] shows up with chocolates.
