# Synopsis
## 
- The [[Cave Scorpion|Cave Scorpions]] have blocked the path of the caravan! The party is stuck between a rock and a ridge. Oh noes!
- The combatants leap into action, immediately engaging with the scorpion menace while the wagons circle up in a defensive posture.
- [[Taliesen]] in his confusion, jumps out of the wagon and wanders into the fray seeking out [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Pryderi]].
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] manages to carry [[Taliesen]] back the waiting arms of [[Hyacinthus]] and [[Balin ferch Balin|Princess Balin]] who carry him back to the safety of the wagons.
- After a few close calls, the scorpions are defeated! 
## 
- The caravan continues on its way back to the city.
- [[Apollo|Prince Apollo]] greets the party and informs them that [[Leto|Queen Leto]] is waiting to talk to everyone.
- [[Leto|Queen Leto]] apologizes for the mix-up with [[Taliesen]], though is still less than pleased with the turn of events regarding, [[Hyacinthus]] and [[Hermes]]. She casts some healing magic on him and imbues him with ~~Power Word: Sleeper Agent~~ knowledge of [[Cavern Elvish]].
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]], [[Issa]], and [[Artemis|Princess Artemis]] confront [[Leto|Queen Leto]] on the goings on at the asylum/black site and broader enforcement of gender norms in the society.
- [[Leto|Queen Leto]] acquiesces to letting [[Artemis|Princess Artemis]] investigate the place.
- [[Leto|Queen Leto]] gives [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] leave to punch [[Zephyr|Dr. Zephyr]] in the face once should he come across her in the streets.
