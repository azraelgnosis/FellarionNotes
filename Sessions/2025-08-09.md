# Synopsis
- As the fight between our heroes and the [[Harpy|Harpies]] initiates, a stranger appears!
- One storm-blown [[Helix]] has noticed the gathered fray and investigates what all the hubbub is about.
- Unfortunate [[Palug]]  gets his leg dislocated in the fight.
- The [[Harpy|Harpies]] fight valiantly and the situation appears dire until, with some creative intimidation checks, the [[Harpy|Harpies]] are put on the back foot. Doubtless, the sight of [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] crawling to their cauldron and [[Eat Fire|eating the flames]] heating it was cause for alarm.
- Oh noes! [[Gwynt]] has contracted the [[Putrid Plague]]!!! And it's looking bad.
- Once returned to camp, [[Aroura]] is enlisted to [[Treat Disease]] on [[Gwynt]] 
- After another day of travel, [[Gwynt]] notices a camp fire in the distance. Who could it belong to?!
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]], [[Desclan Tanner|Desclan]] and [[Helix]] go to scout out the camp fire only to notice two familiar faces.
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] leaps out to confront the pair, [[Cwm]] and [[Cawlwyd]]. They explain how [[Taliesen]] was abducted by dastardly perverse [[Cave Elf|Cave Elves]]
- [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] invites them to join the caravan.
