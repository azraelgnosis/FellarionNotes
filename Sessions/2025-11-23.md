# Synopsis
- [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] returns to the castle, from the asylum via carriage. She can't quite determine the whereabouts of this hidden location.
- [[Apollo]] greets her at the door; [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] explains the situation with [[Hyacinthus]] and [[Taliesen|Ganymede]]/[[Taliesen]] at the asylum.
- [[Cefn ap Balin]] and [[Elrick]] and [[Alrick]] are playing some sort of war games that appears not unlike D&D. Meanwhile, [[Balin ferch Balin|Princess Balin]] is doing her stitching in the corner; definitely not wanting to be invited, AT ALL!
- [[Gwynt]] encourages [[Pryderi ap Rhiannon|Mabrian]] to not pop off at Guard Captain [[Eunomia]]. They agree to go back to consult [[Leto||the Queen]]
- The gang meet up with [[Artemis|Princess Artemis]] on their way back to the palace. They agree to talk to [[Leto|Queen Leto]]  before proceeding but [[Artemis|Princess Artemis]] knows the way if it comes down to it.
- [[Leto|Queen Leto]] is in a meeting with [[Claudia|Princess Claudia]] when they arrive, but they receive a note that [[Petrara Umbriel|Petrara]] is waiting with urgent information regarding [[Taliesen]].
- Everyone (present) shares info!
- A wild [[Omi]] appears! They and [[SharpCracklingGlass]] re-acquaint themselves.
- The gang has a short getting ready montage and shows up near the conference room awaiting the end of the meeting.
- The meeting ends. [[Leto|Queen Leto]] announces that her son, [[Apollo|Prince Apollo]] and [[Claudia|Princess Claudia]] are to ~~fight to the death to determine who gets to rule under the mountain~~ be betrothed and granted land in/on the mountain to serve as intermediaries with the overland world!
- [[Apollo|Prince Apollo]] asserts that he will only agree to this if he is allowed three additional men-in-waiting: [[Hermes]], [[Hyacinthus]], [[Taliesen|Ganymede/Taliesen]]
- [[Leto|Queen Leto]] agrees to ...?

 - [[Artemis|Princess Artemis]] presents the writ from [[Leto|Queen Leto]] to [[Zephyr|Dr. Zephyr]], requesting the release of [[Hermes]], [[Taliesen]], and [[Hyacinthus]]. [[Zephyr|Dr. Zephyr]] seems less than pleased.

- [[Taliesen]] is laying in one of the beds. As [[Zephyr|Dr. Zephyr]] has alluded to, he doesn't seem to be very well.
